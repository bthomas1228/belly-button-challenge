# belly-button-challenge

Please visit https://bthomas1228.github.io/ on git hub pages to see the app deployed. 

If this doesn't work, from the git hub repository linked 'belly-button-challenge', please open the 'app_practice.js' file (the js directory within the static directory). Then open the index file with google chrome or other browser.

To complete this challenge I reviewed the class zoom recordings and activities. Much of what was asked for in the homework was not covered in class so I relied heavily on Xpert Learning Assistant to work my way through and clean up my code. I successfully created the interactive dashboard using the script called 'app_practice.js'. The script used d3.json to read in the samples.json file. 

A Visualizations folder is included to show screen shots of two subject IDs in case the deployed app fails to load. 

Console.log was used to track progress.
